# New Relic - Flex

[![Build Status](https://badge.buildkite.com/fe011ab8474a98a28ac3255e2141ec3887e9accda7d3c31196.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/kav91/nri-flex)

-   Flex is an agnostic AIO New Relic Integration, that can:
    -   Abstract the need for end users to write any code other then to define a configuration yml, allowing you to consume metrics from practically anywhere!
    -   Run any HTTP/S request, read file, shell command, consume from any Prometheus Exporter, Database Query, or JMX Query (Java 7+ is required for JMX to work).
    -   Can generate New Relic metric samples automatically from almost [any endpoint for almost any payload, useful helper functions exist to tidy up your output neatly](#features--support).
    -   Simplies deployment and configuration as a single Flex integration can be running multiple integrations which would be just config files.
    -   Provides over [200+ Integrations](#integrations)
    -   Has agnostic [Service / Container Discovery](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/wiki/Service-Discovery) built-in,
    -   Flex's Service Discovery is tidy, it avoids the need of applying annotations, labels or additional configs against your existing deployments!
    -   Runs on Linux & Windows Hosts and Kubernetes, ECS, Fargate, and other container based platforms.
    -   As updates and upgrades are made, all Flex Integrations reap the benefits.
    -   Can send data via the New Relic Infrastructure Agent, or the New Relic Insights Event API,

---

## Installation

-   Setup your configuration(s) see inside examples/flexConfigs for examples
-   Flex will run everything by default in the default flexConfigs/ folder (so keep what you want before deploy)
-   Flex provides two options for ingesting your events, via the New Relic Infrastructure Agent, & the New Relic Insights Event API

### New Relic Infrastructure Agent Install

#### Installs Flex on Linux with defaults and without any Flex Configs

```
sudo bash -c "$(curl -L https://newrelic-flex.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/install_linux_s3.sh)"

# Unpacked in /tmp/nri-flex-linux-$VERSION/...
```

#### Standard Install

-   [Compiled Releases](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/releases)
-   Review the commented out portions in the install_linux.sh and/or Dockerfile depending on your config setup
-   Run scripts/install_linux.sh or build the docker image
-   Alternatively use the scripts/install_linux.sh as a guide for setting up (or scripts/install_win.bat)

## Standard Configuration

-   Default configuration looks for Flex config files in /flexConfigs.
-   Run ./nri-flex -help for all available flags.
-   Flex has an Event Limiter built in - the event_limit argument is available and there to ensure you don't spam heaps of events unknowingly, the default is 500 per execution/run, which can be dialled up if required.

```
The below two flags you could specific a single Flex Config, or another config directory.

-config_dir string
        Set directory of config files (default "flexConfigs/")
-config_file string
        Set a specific config file

With these flags, you could also define multiple instances with different configurations of Flex within "nri-flex-config.yml"
```

#### Typical file/directory structure layout:

```
/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-flex-config.yml <- config
(/examples/nri-flex-config.yml)

/var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/nri-flex-def-nix.yml <- definition
(/examples/nri-flex-def-nix.yml)

/var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/nri-flex <- binary
(compiled binary)

/var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/flexConfigs/ <- standard flexConfigs (refer to examples here: /examples/flexConfigs)

/var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/flexContainerDiscovery/ <- if using container discovery
(refer to examples here: /examples/flexContainerDiscovery)
```

### New Relic Insights Event API

-   Able to execute the binary wherever and however you like
-   The Flex specific config folders will remain the same
-   To use this method, create an Insert API Key from here: https://insights.newrelic.com/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/manage/api_keys
-   Use the below flags to configure

```
  -insights_api_key string
        Set Insights API key - from link above
  -insights_url string
        Set Insights URL eg. "https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events"
  -insights_output bool
        Output the events generated to standard out true/false
```

-   Run ./nri-flex -help for all available options

#### Typical file/directory structure layout:

```
From any location:

nri-flex <- binary
# below folders in the same location as the binary unless you've specific a different location
flexConfigs/ <- folder
flexContainerDiscovery/ <- folder (v1 service discovery, see v2)
```

### Serverless

[Serverless README](examples/lambdaExample/README.md)

### Kubernetes

-   Build your Docker Image, and deploy as a daemonset, view [examples/nri-flex-k8s.yml](examples/nri-flex-k8s.yml)
-   View wiki for information on how to use [service discovery](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/wiki/Service-Discovery)

## Testing

-   [Compiled Releases](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/releases)
-   For additional logging use the `-verbose` flag

```
Testing a single config
./nri-flex -config_file "examples/flexConfigs/redis-cmd-raw-example.yml"

Running without any flags, will default to run all configs within ./flexConfigs
./nri-flex

Additional Logging
./nri-flex -verbose
```

## Development

### Requirements

-   Make
-   Go 1.13 or later
-   [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) - Dependency management tool
-   [golangci-lint v1.22.2](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)
-   Docker Compose (Integration tests)

### Setup

_Note:_ This assumes that you have a functional Go environment.

```
go get github.com/newrelic/nri-flex

cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/newrelic/nri-flex

# Ensure a clean start
make clean

# Download all required libraries
make dep
```

### Build

```
# Default command runs clean, linter, unit test, and compiles for the local OS
make

# run all tests + linter
make test

# run integration tests
make test-integration

# run unit tests
make test-unit

# run only linter
make lint

# Create a coverage report
make cover

# Launch the coverage report into a web browser
make cover-view
```

### Cross-Compiling

```
# Build binary for current OS
make build

# Build binaries for all supported OSes
make build-all

# Build binaries for a specific OS
make build-darwin
make build-linux
make build-windows
```

### Packaging

To build tar.gz files for distribution:

```
# Create a package for the current OS
make package

# Create packages for all supported OSes
make package-all

# Create packages for a specific OS
make package-darwin
make package-linux
make package-windows
```

### Docker Related

```
# clean/remove any docker containers that have been created
make docker-clean

# Build a new docker image
make docker-image

# Run via docker-compose
make docker-run

# Testing within docker
make docker-test

# Testing with the Infrastructure Agent within Docker
make docker-test-infra
```

### Other Utility Commands

```
# Use godocdown to create Markdown documentation for all commands and packages
# this is run by default.
make document
```

## Releasing

The build process sets the package version based on the latest git tag. After
all changes have been made for the lastest release, make a new tag with NO
commits after, and then `make package-all` to create the artifacts.

This process should be automated someday.

Finally, upload the artifacts on Github to the tag release.

## Contributing

-   Submit a pull request for review.
-   If it's a code change make sure you run "make test" to confirm it's all good.
-   Since Flex has a lot of moving parts, its best to write tests so all contributors don't impact each others work.

## Docker

-   Set your configs, modify Dockerfile if need be
-   Build & Run Image

```
Example:

BUILD
docker build -t nri-flex .

RUN - standard
docker run -d --name nri-flex --network=host --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -v "/:/host:ro" -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" -e NRIA_LICENSE_KEY="yourInfraLicenseKey" nri-flex:latest

RUN - with container discovery reverse lookup (ensure -container_discovery is set to true nri-flex-config.yml)
docker run -d --name nri-flex --network=host --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -l flexDiscoveryRedis="t=redis,c=redis,tt=img,tm=contains,r=true"  -v "/:/host:ro" -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" -e NRIA_LICENSE_KEY="yourInfraLicenseKey" nri-flex:latest

Example: Run Redis with a flex discovery label
docker run -it -p 9696:6379 --label flexDiscoveryRedis="t=redis,c=redis,tt=img,tm=contains" --name redis-svr -d redis
```

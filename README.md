# New Relic - Flex
[![Build Status](https://badge.buildkite.com/fe011ab8474a98a28ac3255e2141ec3887e9accda7d3c31196.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/kav91/nri-flex)

- Flex is an agnostic AIO New Relic Integration, that can:
  - Abstract the need for end users to write any code other then to define a configuration yml, allowing you to consume metrics from practically anywhere!
  - Run any HTTP/S request, read file, shell command, consume from any Prometheus Exporter, Database Query, or JMX Query. (Java 7+ is required for JMX to work)
  - Can generate New Relic metric samples automatically from almost [any endpoint for almost any payload, useful helper functions exist to tidy up your output neatly](#features--support).
  - Simplies deployment and configuration as a single Flex integration can be running multiple integrations which would be just config files.
  - Provides over [200+ Integrations](#integrations)
  - Has agnostic [Service / Container Discovery](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/wiki/Service-Discovery) built-in
  - As updates and upgrades are made, all Flex Intergrations reap the benefits.
  - Can send data via the New Relic Infrastructure Agent, or the New Relic Insights Event API

---

## Testing
```
- [Compiled Releases](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/releases)

Testing a single config
./nri-flex -config_file "examples/flexConfigs/redis-cmd-raw-example.yml"
./nri-flex-mac -config_file "examples/flexConfigs/redis-cmd-raw-example.yml" (take the binary from the mac release)

Running without any flags, will default to run all configs within ./flexConfigs
./nri-flex 
./nri-flex-mac (take the binary from the mac release)
```

## Standard Configuration
- Default configuration looks for Flex config files in /flexConfigs.
- Run ./nri-flex -help for all available flags.
- Flex has an Event Limiter built in - the event_limit argument is available and there to ensure you don't spam heaps of events unknowingly, the default is 500 per execution/run, which can be dialled up if required.

``` 
The below two flags you could specific a single Flex Config, or another config directory.

-config_dir string
        Set directory of config files (default "flexConfigs/")
-config_file string
        Set a specific config file

With these flags, you could also define multiple instances with different configurations of Flex within "nri-flex-config.yml" 
```

## Installation

- Setup your configuration(s) see inside examples/flexConfigs for examples
- Flex will run everything by default in the default flexConfigs/ folder (so keep what you want before deploy)
- Flex provides two options for ingesting your events, via the New Relic Infrastructure Agent, & the New Relic Insights Event API

### New Relic Infrastructure Agent
- Review the commented out portions in the install_linux.sh and/or Dockerfile depending on your config setup
- Run scripts/install_linux.sh or build the docker image
- Alternatively use the scripts/install_linux.sh as a guide for setting up (or scripts/install_win.bat)

#### Typical file/directory structure layout:
```
/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nri-flex-config.yml <- config 
(/examples/nri-flex-config.yml)

/var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/nri-flex-def-nix.yml <- definition 
(/examples/nri-flex-def-nix.yml)

/var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/nri-flex <- binary 
(compiled binary)

/var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/flexConfigs/ <- standard flexConfigs (refer to examples here: /examples/flexConfigs)

/var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/flexContainerDiscovery/ <- if using container discovery 
(refer to examples here: /examples/flexContainerDiscovery)
```

### New Relic Insights Event API

- Able to execute the binary wherever and however you like
- The Flex specific config folders will remain the same
- To use this method, create an Insert API Key from here: https://insights.newrelic.com/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/manage/api_keys
- Use the below flags to configure
```
  -insights_api_key string
        Set Insights API key - from link above
  -insights_url string
        Set Insights URL eg. "https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events"
  -insights_output bool
        Output the events generated to standard out true/false
```
- Run ./nri-flex -help for all available options

#### Typical file/directory structure layout:
```
From any location:

nri-flex <- binary
# below folders in the same location as the binary unless you've specific a different location
flexConfigs/ <- folder
flexContainerDiscovery/ <- folder
```

## Development
```
Docker compose & dep required.

make setup - download all needed dependencies

go run cmd/flex/nri-flex.go - run locally

make test - run all tests + linter
make view - view test coverage report
make lint - run only linter

make clean-docker - clean/remove any docker containers that have been created

make build - build for current OS
make build-linux - build for linux
make build-darwin - build for MacOS / Darwin
make build-windows - build for Windows
make build-all - build for all above OS's

make package-linux - create a linux release package
make package-windows - create a windows release package
make package-darwin - create a mac release package
make package-all - creates linux, windows & mac release packages

```

## Contributing
- Submit a pull request for review.
- If it's a code change make sure you run "make test" to confirm it's all good.
- Since Flex has a lot of moving parts, its best to write tests so all contributors don't impact each others work.

## Docker
- Set your configs, modify Dockerfile if need be
- Build & Run Image

```
Example:

BUILD
docker build -t nri-flex .

RUN - standard
docker run -d --name nri-flex --network=host --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -v "/:/host:ro" -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" -e NRIA_LICENSE_KEY="yourInfraLicenseKey" nri-flex:latest

RUN - with container discovery reverse lookup (ensure -container_discovery is set to true nri-flex-config.yml)
docker run -d --name nri-flex --network=host --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -l flexDiscoveryRedis="t=redis,c=redis,tt=img,tm=contains,r=true"  -v "/:/host:ro" -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" -e NRIA_LICENSE_KEY="yourInfraLicenseKey" nri-flex:latest

Example: Run Redis with a flex discovery label
docker run -it -p 9696:6379 --label flexDiscoveryRedis="t=redis,c=redis,tt=img,tm=contains" --name redis-svr -d redis
```

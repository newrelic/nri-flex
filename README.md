# New Relic Flex

Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one [New Relic integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations) with which you can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a [config file](/docs/basics/configure.md), start the Infrastructure agent, and data starts pouring into New Relic.

Flex can take any input using [data source APIs](/docs/apis/README.md), process it through [functions](/docs/basics/functions.md), and send metric samples to New Relic as if they came from an integration:

For a quick introduction on Flex, [read our blog post](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/how-to-use-new-relic-flex/). You can also have a look at the [200+ example integrations](#example-integrations)!

## What you need

Flex requires a [New Relic account](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account) and is compatible with the following operating systems/platforms:

- Linux
- Windows
- Kubernetes

For more information on compatible distros and versions, see the [Infrastructure agent compatibility page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure).

## Installation

Flex comes bundled with the New Relic infrastructure agent. To install the infrastructure agent, see [Install the infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic).

If you're using Kubernetes, see [Configure Flex in Kubernetes](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/blob/master/docs/basics/k8s_configure.md).

## Getting started

The [Flex step-by-step tutorial](./docs/basic-tutorial.md) is a great starting point.

### Example integrations

All examples are located in [/examples](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/tree/master/examples).

> Note that some examples may use features that are [experimental](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/tree/master/docs/experimental) (not officially supported) or [deprecated](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/tree/master/docs/experimental).

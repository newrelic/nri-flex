# This custom integration uses flex to query Azure SQL for custom metrics. Notes are below.
#
# Azure Entra ID(formerly Active Directory) authentication uses temporary authentication tokens to authenticate and connect to your Azure SQL database.   
# The Azure SQL database needs to be configured to use Entra ID admin service principal as a way to connect. 
# You can authenticate using either fedauth=ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal or fedauth=ActiveDirectoryApplication 
# Which authenticates using an Azure Active Directory application client ID and client secret or certificate.
# The certifcate format should be clientcertpath=<path to certificate file>;password=<certificate password>
# Other options including using Azure Managed Identity or Active directory passwords are also available and are explained here https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb?tab=readme-ov-file#azure-active-directory-authentication

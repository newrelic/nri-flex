integrations:
  # This integration curls the fluentbit health check endpoint for a status. 
  # If 200 then ok is returned. 
  # If 500 then error is returned.
  # The health check endpoint is disabled by default.
  # At the moment this integration only works with standalone fluent-bit
  # The link to enable the health check endpoint is here: 
  # https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/monitoring#health-check-for-fluent-bit

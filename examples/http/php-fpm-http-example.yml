# To use this integration you must configure the FPM Status page on your server. 
# Typically this involves
# Edit /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf
# Ensure pm.status_path = /fpm_status is uncommented
# Save php config and test -  sudo php-fpm -t
# Restart PHP
# Edit Nginx config /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
# Define a status or ping url. Ensure that the pm.status_path has a matching entire in the location block - This is a sample block
# and you may need to change fastcgi_pass to reference how your setup passes to PHP.
# location ~ ^/(status|ping|fpm_status)$ {
#       allow 127.0.0.1;
#       fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
#       fastcgi_index index.php;
#       include fastcgi_params;
#       #fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
#       fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/php7.2-fpm.sock;
#}
# Test new Nginx config - nginx -t
# Restart Nginx
# Test access at yourdomain.com/fpm_status

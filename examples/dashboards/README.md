# Overview

This directory holds examples of dashboards that can be created using data collected by various Flex configurations. 

You can quickly use these samples by editing “OWNER_EMAIL_ADDRESS” and “ACCOUNT_ID” in the source JSON and then applying the payload to your New Relic account using the [API Explorer](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/create).

More details about the Dashboards API can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-api/manage-dashboards/insights-dashboard-api) and in an introductory [blog post](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/insights-dashboard-api/) on the New Relic website.

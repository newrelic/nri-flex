# FLEX step-by-step basic tutorial

Requirements:

* Infrastructure Agent version 1.8.x or higher.
  - Flex can also work with older versions, but this tutorial relies on the
    latest integrations engine, which has been added in the version 1.8.0.
  - [Please check the documentation to learn more](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180)       
* Run the Infrastructure Agent in Root/Administrator mode. 
  - It is the user that executes the Agent by default.  
  - Current versions of Flex require administrator permissions for the
    management of temporary files.
* Flex 0.8.5 or higher.
  - This version is prepared to easily work with the new integrations system of
    the Infrastructure Agent 1.8.0, as used in this tutorial.
  - Previous versions of Flex also work, but would require few extra configuration
    steps that are not addressed in this tutorial.

## Install

You can download Flex for Windows and Linux from the [Flex releases page](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/releases).

The Flex package comes with an installer script (`install_linux.sh` or `install_windows.bat`).
It is aimed at installing all the required files for older versions of the Agent, and also
start/stopping the Agent service so the changes take effect.

From the Infrastructure Agent version 1.8.0 and later, you just need manually copy the `nri-flex` executable from the
tarball into the `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/` folder:

Steps (from a command-line):
```
$ wget https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/releases/download/v0.8.5/nri-flex-linux-0.8.5.tar.gz
$ tar xzf nri-flex-linux-0.8.5.tar.gz
$ sudo cp nri-flex-linux-0.8.5/nri-flex /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/
```

> Windows users: copy the `nri-flex.exe` file into `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\newrelic-integrations`. 

Flex is now installed and ready to work with the agent.

## Checking that Flex is up and running

1. Create a file named `my-flex-configs.yml` (or any other name of your choose) into the
   `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d` folder. 
    - Windows users: `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d` folder.
2. Set the following contents for the previously created file:
   ```yaml
   integrations:
     - name: nri-flex
       config:
         name: just-testing
   ```
3. Go to Insights and run the following query:

```sql
from flexStatusSample select * LIMIT 1
```

The query should show a table similar to this:

### What happened behind the scenes

1. The Infrastructure Agent detected that a new integration, named `nri-flex`, has been added.
2. The Agent looks for an executable named `nri-flex` in `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/`.
3. A temporary text configuration file is created with the following contents:
   ```yaml
   name: just-testing
   ```
4. `nri-flex` is executed receiving the path of the above YAML file via the `CONFIG_PATH` environment
   variable.
5. Flex recognizes a configuration named `just-testing`, but since it does not provide extra information
   it just returns a `flexStatusSample` with some internal status of the Flex integration.

## Our first Flex integration

For this example, you will need a linux-based operating system, as it depends on Unix commands
that won't work in windows. However, a similar result would be achieved in Windows with few changes.

This example is about reporting disk metrics from file systems not natively supported by
New Relic using the `df` (Disk Free) command.

The objective of flex is to convert the text output of this command (disk free showing
file system, 1-byte blocks, and excluding the file systems already supported by the agent):

```
$ df -PT -B1 -x tmpfs -x xfs -x vxfs -x btrfs -x ext -x ext2 -x ext3 -x ext4
Filesystem     Type         1-blocks         Used    Available Capacity Mounted on
devtmpfs       devtmpfs    246296576            0    246296576       0% /dev
go_src         vboxsf   499963170816 361339486208 138623684608      73% /go/src
``` 

> If your system does not mount any unsupported file system, you can remove the trailing `-x` arguments for testing.

Converting the above tabular text output into a set of equivalent JSON samples with this format:

```json
{
  "event": {
    "event_type": "FileSystemSample",
    "fs": "go_src",
    "fsType": "vboxsf",
    "capacityBytes": 499963170816,
    "usedBytes": 361345331200,
    "availableBytes": 138617839616,
    "usedPerc": 73,
    "mountedOn": "/go/src",
  }
}
```

> Notice that the Agent will decorate each sample with extra fields

You need to tell Flex how to perform the above "table text to JSON" transformation,
concretely:

- Name of the metric (`FileSystem`). Flex will append the `Sample` suffix, resulting into
  `FileSystemSample`.
- Which command to run `df -PT -B1 ...`.
- How to split the output table from `df` and how to assign those values to given metric
  names.

This is achieved placing the content below in the YAML configuration file from the previous
section:

```yaml
integrations:
  - name: nri-flex
    config:
      name: linuxFileSystemIntegration
      apis:
        - name: FileSystem
          commands:
            - run: 'df -PT -B1 -x tmpfs -x xfs -x vxfs -x btrfs -x ext -x ext2 -x ext3 -x ext4'
              split: horizontal
              split_by: \s+
              set_header: [fs,fsType,capacityBytes,usedBytes,availableBytes,usedPerc,mountedOn]
          perc_to_decimal: true
```

Sections from the above YAML worth mentioning: 

- The `apis` section is an array of entries for each sample. Each entry sets a name for the
  sample, as well as the commands/procedures to get it and how to process it.
- First `apis` entry is named `FileSystem` (it will be used to construct the `FileSystemSample`
  event name).
- In the `commands` section, we specify how to get the information, basically:
    - `run: 'df -PT -B1...` specifies the command to run.
    - `split: horizontal` states that each output line may return a metric.
    - `split_by` explains how to split each line in different fields. In this case, we use
      a regular expression `\s+` telling that any sequence of 1 or more white spaces should
      be considered a separator. E.g. it would divide a line like:
      ```
      devtmpfs       devtmpfs    246296576            0    246296576       0% /dev
      ```
      Into an array containing `["devtmpfs", "devtmpfs", "246296576", "0", "246296576", "0%", "/dev"]`
    - `set_header` specifies, in order, a matching name for each value of the aforementioned array.
    - `perc_to_decimal: true` aims for converting any percentage string into a decimal value
      (this is, removing the trailing `%` symbol, if exists).

**Once the Flex config is created, the Infrastructure Agent will auto-detect the new config and begin collecting data.**

To check that our new integration is working, you can try executing the following query
in Insights:

```sql
FROM FileSystemSample SELECT mountedOn, fs, usedBytes, capacityBytes, usedBytes
```

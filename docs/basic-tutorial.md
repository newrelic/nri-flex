# Flex step-by-step tutorial

Follow this tutorial to get started with Flex!

##Â Requirements

* Infrastructure agent version 1.8 or higher.
  - Flex can also work with older versions, but this tutorial relies on the latest integrations engine which has been added in the [version 1.8.0](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180).  
* Run the Infrastructure agent in root/administrator mode. 
  - Current versions of Flex require administrator permissions for the management of temporary files.
* Flex 0.8.5 or higher.
  - This version is prepared to work with the new integrations system introduced by the Infrastructure agent 1.8.0, which is used in this tutorial.
  - Previous versions of Flex also work, but require few extra configuration steps that are not addressed by this tutorial.

## Installation

Starting from New Relic Infrastructure agent version 1.10.0, Flex is bundled with the agent in the same package, so you don't need to perform any extra step for its installation.

## Check that Flex is up and running

1. Create a file named `my-flex-configs.yml` (or similar) in this folder:
    * Linux: `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d`
    * Windows: `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d`
2. Edit the file and add this snippet:
   ```yaml
   integrations:
     - name: nri-flex
       config:
         name: just-testing
   ```
3. Go to New Relic and run the following [NRQL query](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language):

```sql
FROM flexStatusSample SELECT * LIMIT 1
```

The query should produce a table similar to this:

### What happened behind the scenes

1. The Infrastructure agent detected that a new integration, `nri-flex`, has been added.
2. The agent looks for an executable named `nri-flex` in `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/`.
3. A temporary configuration file is created with this content:
   ```yaml
   name: just-testing
   ```
4. `nri-flex` is executed and gets the path of the config file via the `CONFIG_PATH` environment
   variable.
5. Flex recognizes a configuration named `just-testing`, but since it does not provide extra information
   it just returns a `flexStatusSample` with some internal status of the Flex integration.

## Our first Flex integration

For this example, you will need a linux-based operating system, as it depends on Unix commands
that won't work in windows. However, a similar result would be achieved in Windows with few changes.

This example is about reporting disk metrics from file systems not natively supported by
New Relic using the `df` (Disk Free) command.

The objective of flex is to convert the text output of this command (disk free showing
file system, 1-byte blocks, and excluding the file systems already supported by the agent):

```
$ df -PT -B1 -x tmpfs -x xfs -x vxfs -x btrfs -x ext -x ext2 -x ext3 -x ext4
Filesystem     Type         1-blocks         Used    Available Capacity Mounted on
devtmpfs       devtmpfs    246296576            0    246296576       0% /dev
go_src         vboxsf   499963170816 361339486208 138623684608      73% /go/src
``` 

> If your system does not mount any unsupported file system, you can remove the trailing `-x` arguments for testing.

Converting the above tabular text output into a set of equivalent JSON samples with this format:

```json
{
  "event": {
    "event_type": "FileSystemSample",
    "fs": "go_src",
    "fsType": "vboxsf",
    "capacityBytes": 499963170816,
    "usedBytes": 361345331200,
    "availableBytes": 138617839616,
    "usedPerc": 73,
    "mountedOn": "/go/src",
  }
}
```

> Notice that the Agent will decorate each sample with extra fields

You need to tell Flex how to perform the above "table text to JSON" transformation,
concretely:

- Name of the metric (`FileSystem`). Flex will append the `Sample` suffix, resulting into
  `FileSystemSample`.
- Which command to run `df -PT -B1 ...`.
- How to split the output table from `df` and how to assign those values to given metric
  names.

This is achieved placing the content below in the YAML configuration file from the previous
section:

```yaml
integrations:
  - name: nri-flex
    config:
      name: linuxFileSystemIntegration
      apis:
        - name: FileSystem
          commands:
            - run: 'df -PT -B1 -x tmpfs -x xfs -x vxfs -x btrfs -x ext -x ext2 -x ext3 -x ext4'
              split: horizontal
              split_by: \s+
              set_header: [fs,fsType,capacityBytes,usedBytes,availableBytes,usedPerc,mountedOn]
          perc_to_decimal: true
```

Sections from the above YAML worth mentioning: 

- The `apis` section is an array of entries for each sample. Each entry sets a name for the
  sample, as well as the commands/procedures to get it and how to process it.
- First `apis` entry is named `FileSystem` (it will be used to construct the `FileSystemSample`
  event name).
- In the `commands` section, we specify how to get the information, basically:
    - `run: 'df -PT -B1...` specifies the command to run.
    - `split: horizontal` states that each output line may return a metric.
    - `split_by` explains how to split each line in different fields. In this case, we use
      a regular expression `\s+` telling that any sequence of 1 or more white spaces should
      be considered a separator. E.g. it would divide a line like:
      ```
      devtmpfs       devtmpfs    246296576            0    246296576       0% /dev
      ```
      Into an array containing `["devtmpfs", "devtmpfs", "246296576", "0", "246296576", "0%", "/dev"]`
    - `set_header` specifies, in order, a matching name for each value of the aforementioned array.
    - `perc_to_decimal: true` aims for converting any percentage string into a decimal value
      (this is, removing the trailing `%` symbol, if exists).

**Once the Flex config is created, the Infrastructure Agent will auto-detect the new config and begin collecting data.**

To check that our new integration is working, you can try executing the following query
in Insights:

```sql
FROM FileSystemSample SELECT mountedOn, fs, usedBytes, capacityBytes, usedBytes
```

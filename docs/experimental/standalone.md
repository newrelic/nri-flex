# Standalone mode

> **Disclaimer**: this function is bundled as alpha. That means that it is not yet supported by New Relic.

Flex can run without the infrastructure agent reporting telemetry directly to New Relic [Event API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/event-api/introduction-event-api/). 

## Steps to setup Flex standalone
1. Get the Flex executable on your target host. If the infrastructure agent is installed, use the default installation paths:
  * Linux: `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-flex`
  * Windows: `C:/Program Files/New Relic/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/nri-flex.exe`
  * macOS: Flex is not bundled with the infrastructure agent on macOS.

    You can also download the lastest package from [Github releases](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/releases) and extract it in your target host.

2. Prepare the execution command with the expected parameters as explained below. 

3. Determine when and how Flex should be executed. For example, define a cronjob to execute it on a fixed interval. 

4. Check data is reported as expected in New Relic UI.

Refer to [troubleshooting](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration/#troubleshooting) documentation for help. 

## Running Flex without the infrastructure agent

Command examle:
```
  /path/to/nri-flex -insights_api_key YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -insights_url https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events -config_path /path/to/YOUR_CONFIG.yml
```

* Adapt the path to point to your local executable for `nri-flex`
* Replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with your ingest key.
* Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` with your New Relic account. 
* For EU accounts, use `insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net`.
* Adapt the path to point to your local Flex configuration / integration.
